# CloudMind: Scalable, Serverless AI Platform

CloudMind is a cutting-edge, serverless AI platform designed to blend knowledge, memory, and advanced reasoning capabilities into one elegant solution. Capable of scaling to millions of concurrent executions and handling complex tasks (up to 15 minutes per task), CloudMind transforms user-provided ideas and tasks into actionable plans. It integrates with chat tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) and enterprise systems (e.g., Jira, Confluence) to support real-time collaboration and decision-making.

## Features

- **Advanced Reasoning:**  
  Switch between basic and advanced reasoning with a simple configuration change.
- **Knowledge & Memory Integration:**  
  Access persistent knowledge bases (e.g., Neptune, S3) and maintain session/long-term memory in DynamoDB.
- **Serverless Scalability:**  
  Built on AWS Lambda, Step Functions, API Gateway, and EventBridge to achieve massive concurrency.
- **Long-Running Workflows:**  
  Orchestrate tasks with durations of up to 15 minutes (9,000 seconds) using AWS Step Functions.
- **Extensible & Modular:**  
  A minimal code base that allows you to swap or enhance modules (e.g., advanced reasoning engine) with a single line change.

## Architecture Overview

CloudMind consists of:

1. **User Interface & Ingestion:**  
   Integrates with chat tools and uses API Gateway/EventBridge to ingest tasks.

2. **Workflow Orchestration:**  
   Uses AWS Step Functions to coordinate multi-step workflows including:
   - Loading knowledge and memory
   - Advanced reasoning
   - Executing action plans
   - Updating memory

3. **Data Stores & Knowledge Management:**  
   - **DynamoDB:** Memory storage
   - **Neptune/Knowledge Graph:** Organizational context
   - **S3/QLDB:** Audit logs and versioning

4. **Processing & Reasoning:**  
   - **AWS Lambda:** Modular functions for ingestion, reasoning, and execution.
   - A switchable reasoning engine (`MODE` environment variable: `basic` or `advanced`).

5. **Scalability & High-Concurrency:**  
   - Serverless and event-driven architecture ensures that the solution scales to millions of requests.
   - Provisioned concurrency, SQS, and auto scaling handle load bursts.
